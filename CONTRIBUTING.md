# Guide on Contributing

Red Button Trainer is not only for training for red buttons. It is also a great
place to try out new tech and practice your coding skills. Contributions don't
need to be only code changes. Other contributions can be documentation, design,
issue reporting and others.

There is also this helpful guide on
[How to contribute to an open source project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Bug Reports

Found a bug or 'undocumented feature'? Please create an issue on this project
with as much detail as necessary in how to reproduce it if applicable. It might
just be specific to the web browser that you are using, so add the name of the
browser as well.
